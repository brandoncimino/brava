Brandon's Java utilities.

== Publishing to Maven Central

. Created an account on https://central.sonatype.org/
_(which is actually "Maven Central", or maybe "Nexus"?)_.
- Linked my Github account, which automatically created the `io.github.brandoncimino` "namespace" _(actually the Maven `groupId`)_.

=== Creating "GPG Key(s)"

[NOTE]
====
"GPG", "GnuPG", and "GNU Privacy Guard" all refer to the command line tool `gpg`.
====

. Installed the _(windows version of the)_ `gpg` command line tool from https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Gpg4win[chocolatey]:
+
[source,powershell]
choco install gpg4win -a

. Generated the so-called "GPG Key(s)":
+
--
[source,powershell]
gpg --gen-key

Entering my:

- Name as `Brandon Cimino`
- Email as `brandon.cimino@gmail.com`
--

. Entered a "passphrase" _(henceforth referred to as 💬)_ in a popup application window
. From the output of the command, took the value of 🔐 _(I have no idea if this value is sensitive or not)_

[source,powershell]
pub   ed25519 2024-07-22 [SC] [expires: 2027-07-22]
      🔐
uid                      Brandon Cimino <brandon.cimino@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2024-07-22 [E] [expires: 2027-07-22]

. "Exported the key to a server" 🤷‍♀️

[source,powershell]
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys 🔐

. Added secret keys to my Github account _(📎 This is *not* the same as https://github.com/devuri/A-Guide-to-Generating-and-Using-GPG-Keys-on-GitHub#Step%204:%20Add%20the%20GPG%20key%20to%20GitHub:~:text=Step%204%3A%20Add%20the%20GPG%20key%20to%20GitHub[Step 4: Add the GPG keys to Github])_

[source,powershell]

# ⚠ This must be done from within the relevant Git repository (in my case, `~/dev/brava`)
$gpgKeyId = "🔐"
$gpgPassphrase = "💬"
$gpgPublicContent = gpg --armor --export $gpgKeyId | Join-String -Separator "`n"
gh secret set JRELEASER_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY --body $gpgPublicContent

# This command will open a popup application window, where you will be required to enter your "passphrase" (💬)
$gpgSecretContent = gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $gpgKeyId | Join-String -Separator "`n"
gh secret set JRELEASER_GPG_SECRET_KEY --body $gpgSecretContent

gh secret set JRELEASER_GPG_PASSPHRASE --body $gpgPassphrase

# ⚠ I'm not sure if these will be relevant, since I created my "Sonatype" (aka Maven Central?) account by authenticating via Github directly.
# ⚠️ Oct. 26, 2024: Don't know what this are, where I got them from, or why they include `-jira-` 🤷‍♀️
#gh secret set JRELEASER_NEXUS2_USERNAME --body <sonatype-jira-username>
#gh secret set JRELEASER_NEXUS2_PASSWORD --body <sonatype-jira-password>

[TIP]
====
The secrets should now show up on https://github.com/brandoncimino/brava/settings/secrets/actions as:

- `JRELEASER_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
- `JRELEASER_GPG_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `JRELEASER_GPG_SECRET_KEY`

NOTE: These are saved in my GitHub notes in Bitwarden.

// TODO: Where did I get all this junk in my gradle file from? What even is `JReleaser`?
