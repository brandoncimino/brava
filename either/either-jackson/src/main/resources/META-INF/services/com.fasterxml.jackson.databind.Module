# This file lists the modules that Jackson will automatically load when you call JsonMapper.Builder#findAndAddModules().
#
# The file *must* be located in the folder:
#   src/main/resources/META-INF/services/
#
# And have the name:
#   com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module
#
# Each entry should be the fully-qualified name of a class that extends com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module.
# TODO: I'm also pretty sure that the package of the module itself has to be `com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.{x}`, but I can't find any documentation for that at the moment... 
com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.brava.EitherModule
